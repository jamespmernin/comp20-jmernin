Is it possible to request the data from a different origin or from your local
machine from using XMLHttpRequest? Why or why not?

Because of the same-origin policy, requesting data from a different origin is
not possible, in order to protect from malicious programs that could
potentially manipulate files.

It is possible to request data from your local machine  using XMLHttpRequest.
This happens because the request is made to the same host as the original web
page, which means the request complies with the same-origin policy.
