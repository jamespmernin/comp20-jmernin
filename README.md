1. What is the purpose of this Git repository?
	The purpose of this Git repository is to keep all of the work I've done for the course in one place and to showcase at the end of the course the amount of learning I did.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	I liked the lab about changing images based on resizing windows because I was able to understand what to do quickly and easily. It made me feel better about my ability to piece together solutions to practical application problems.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	I actually think I was more confident in my ability when the semester started than I am now that it's ending. I guess I came to realize that web development isn't as straightforward as I originally thought, so I have a greater respect for it than I did to start.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
	The most important thing I learned was to ask for help about major assignments earlier on. I could have done better on homework assignments 2 and 3 if I had reached out for advice sooner.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	Client-side coding is more interesting to me than server-side, so that is an area I would be more willing to explore.
